### “Towards a Philosophy of Software Development: 40 Years after the Birth of Software Engineering” written by Northover, Kourie, Boake, Gruner, and Northover is unique in it’s methodology of analyzing the philosophical foundations and premises of software engineering, claiming it “has roots both in computer science and classical engineering.” Categorizing software engineering as a relatively new discipline, the authors claim that its philosophical assessment is rather hard since the upcoming discipline “is still in a state of ambiguity.” This opens up a conversation in the field of software development and the umbrella field of computer science and classical engineering about its relation with philosophy and opens up a horizon of possibilities and insights that could be gauged by the merging of these two fields.
